Vinted Scheduler

This Vinted Scheduler helps you automatically publish items on Vinted at times you choose. Instead of manually logging in early in the morning or waiting around for each item to go live, the bot does it for you—step by step.

What Does It Do?
	1.	Logs In
The bot signs into your Vinted account using your username and password.
	2.	Publishes Your Drafts
You create your listings as “drafts” ahead of time. At the scheduled start time (for example, 6:00 AM), the bot automatically publishes the first draft.
	3.	Checks When Each Listing Goes Live
Vinted sometimes delays new listings for verification. The bot watches your listing and knows when it’s really live—often by detecting if it’s received at least 1 view.
	4.	Waits, Then Publishes the Next
After each listing goes live, the bot waits a certain amount of time (say, 30 minutes or 1 hour) before publishing the next draft. This continues until all drafts are published or you stop the bot.

Main Benefits
	•	Hands-Off Scheduling: No need to wake up early or time your listings manually.
	•	Spacing Out Listings: Ensures your items are published at regular intervals, helping you avoid posting everything at once.
	•	Automatic Verification Wait: It waits for Vinted’s “go-live” delay so you don’t have to keep checking your account.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: You can start and stop the bot with a simple webpage on your computer.

How To Use
	1.	Install & Run
	•	You’ll have a simple folder with the bot’s files.
	•	Double-check your username and password in the bot’s config.yaml (or as instructed by your developer).
	•	Run the bot using a single command (for instance, python app.py)—exact steps may vary by computer.
	2.	Open the Control Panel
	•	In your web browser, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000.
	•	Here, you can set the Start Time for the first listing and how many minutes to wait between listings.
	3.	Click “Start Bot”
	•	The bot logs in, waits until the start time, and publishes your first draft.
	•	It checks if the item is live, then waits your chosen interval and publishes the next item, repeating until done.
	4.	Stop the Bot (Optional)
	•	If you change your mind, click Stop Bot to halt everything. (Implementation may vary.)
	5.	Watch the Logs
	•	A “Logs” section shows the bot’s progress: when it publishes, detects a listing going live, and so on.

Frequently Asked Questions
	1.	Is it safe to use?
	•	The bot needs your login to publish items on your behalf. Keep your password secure and do not share the bot’s folder with others who shouldn’t have access to your account.
	2.	Will I get banned for automating?
	•	Always check Vinted’s terms of service. Generally, users have successfully used bots for routine tasks, but it’s up to you to ensure compliance.
	3.	Can I still manually publish listings?
	•	Yes. The bot just saves you from having to do it at very specific times. You can still create new drafts or publish manually whenever you like.
	4.	Do I need coding skills?
	•	Basic understanding of installing Python and running a command (e.g., python app.py) is helpful. Beyond that, you’ll control the bot through a simple web page.

Tips & Troubleshooting
	•	Check Credentials: Make sure your username/password are correct in the settings.
	•	Vinted Changes: If Vinted updates its website, some of the bot’s steps might break. You (or your developer) will need to update the bot’s internal instructions.
	•	Interval Choice: Common intervals range from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on how spaced out you want your listings.

Disclaimer

This tool is provided “as is” and may require updates if Vinted changes how their site works. Always make sure you have permission to automate actions on any platform and comply with their terms of service.

Enjoy scheduling your Vinted listings, and save yourself time!

Short Answer
Selenium automates web browsers so you can simulate user actions (clicking, typing, navigating, etc.) in a script. In this Vinted Scheduler program, Selenium logs into your Vinted account, opens the Drafts page, and clicks the “Publish” button, just like a real user would.

What Selenium Does in This Program
	1.	Logs in to Vinted
	•	The bot enters your username/password into the login form and submits it automatically.
	2.	Navigates to Drafts
	•	After logging in, Selenium “drives” the browser to the Drafts page to find unpublished items.
	3.	Clicks “Publish”
	•	The bot uses Selenium to locate the on-screen “Publish” button and clicks it.
	•	It can handle any pop-up confirmations or redirect pages that appear next.
	4.	Checks If a Listing Is Live
	•	The bot navigates to the newly published listing’s URL and checks elements (like a “view count”) to see if it’s public yet.
	5.	Runs Headlessly If Needed
	•	Selenium can run with a visible Chrome/Firefox window or in “headless” mode (no visible browser), so it can operate on a server or in the background.

Overall, Selenium acts as your virtual user, replicating the clicks and keypresses you would typically do by hand.

General Use of Selenium
	•	Browser Automation: Selenium is most commonly used for automated testing of web applications, simulating real user interactions to confirm everything works as expected.
	•	Web Scraping (When Allowed): Because Selenium can navigate dynamic pages (loaded with JavaScript), it’s sometimes used to extract data from sites that don’t have a direct API (although dedicated scraping libraries are often faster if minimal JS is needed).
	•	Task Automation: Any time you need to automate repetitive tasks on a website—such as form submissions, data entry, or account management—Selenium can handle it, as if you were manually controlling the browser.

Why Use Selenium vs. Other Tools?
	1.	No Public API: If Vinted doesn’t offer an API for publishing listings, you need a tool to “click the website” for you.
	2.	Dynamic Content: Many modern sites load content dynamically via JavaScript. Selenium can wait for these elements to load before interacting with them.
	3.	Real Browser Environment: Selenium runs inside a real browser (or a headless version of one), so it behaves similarly to a true user session. This reduces issues with JavaScript execution or site features that rely on the browser environment.

In short, Selenium is the core engine for browser automation in your Vinted Scheduler, allowing your Python code to control the entire user experience—logging in, navigating pages, and pushing buttons.
